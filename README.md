# CS333 - Network Security and Defense In-Class Exercises

Please fork this repository and clone it to your local machine. This repository will contain all the in-class exercises for CS333 - Computer Networks. As we cover different topics, I'll be adding scripts and code snippets here for you to work with.

You will be expected to complete the exercises during class, if you don't come to class you will miss out on the opportunity to learn how to write these scripts and understand how they work and you will still be responsible for the material on the exams. You can work in groups, but every student must turn in their own script. Every group member can have the exact same code, you are encouraged to work together and help each other, but you need to make sure you understand how the code works and can explain it if asked. **Anything** that is turned in is fair game for potential questions on the exam, so make sure you understand the code you submit.

You will do periodic pull requests to submit your completed exercises. Each exercise will have its own directory with a README file containing instructions and requirements. Please check Canvas each week for details on submitting your work for a grade.

## Legal Issues

> [!CAUTION]
> Please be careful when running some of these scripts. Do NOT run aggressive scans on the lab network without permission. Always start with a simple ping sweep to discover hosts before doing more thorough scans. Tools like Nmap can be very powerful and can cause disruptions if used improperly, some systems (such as AWS) may even block your IP and ban your account if you run too many scans. Always ask your instructor if you are unsure about which scan to run.  More details can be found [here](https://nmap.org/book/legal-issues.html).

> [!TIP]
> All activities that we do in the lab are legal and ethical because we have explicit permission to scan the lab network.
